# Lesson 1: Introduction to PyTorch Fundamentals

Welcome to the first lesson in our series on audio processing with PyTorch. In this lesson, we'll dive into the basics of PyTorch, a powerful library for building machine learning models. We'll explore how to create tensors, perform basic operations, and understand the core concepts that make PyTorch a favorite among data scientists and AI researchers.

## What is PyTorch?
P
yTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It provides a flexible and intuitive framework for building and training neural networks, with a strong focus on deep learning. PyTorch is known for its dynamic computational graph, ease of use, and efficient memory usage.

## Getting Started with Tensors
Tensors are the fundamental building blocks in PyTorch. They are similar to arrays and matrices and are used to encode the inputs and outputs of a model, as well as the model's parameters.

## Creating a Tensor
Let's start by creating a simple tensor. Tensors in PyTorch can be created using the torch.tensor() function.

```py
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
print("Tensor:", x)
```

In this code snippet, we import the torch module and create a tensor x from a Python list [1, 2, 3]. We can then print the tensor to see its contents.

## Basic Operations

PyTorch tensors support a wide range of operations. Let's perform some basic arithmetic operations on our tensor.

### Tensor Addition

You can add two tensors element-wise using the + operator.

```py
# Basic operations
y = x + x
print("Tensor addition:", y)
```

This operation adds the tensor x to itself, resulting in a new tensor y where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in x.

### Element-wise Multiplication
Similarly, tensors can be multiplied element-wise using the * operator.

```py
# More operations
z = x * x
print("Element-wise multiplication:", z)
```

This code multiplies each element of the tensor x by itself, demonstrating how to perform element-wise multiplication.

## Advanced Tensor Operations in PyTorch

While basic tensor operations are fundamental, mastering more advanced manipulations is crucial for dealing with real-world data and complex neural network architectures. In this section, we'll explore advanced tensor operations that are particularly useful in audio processing and general machine learning tasks.

### Flattening Tensors

Flattening a tensor means transforming it into a one-dimensional tensor. This operation is often used when you need to feed tensors into a neural network layer that expects a certain input size.
```py
# Create a 2D tensor
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Flatten the tensor
flat_x = x.flatten()

print("Flattened Tensor:", flat_x)
```

### Handling Mismatched Tensor Sizes

When performing operations on two tensors, their sizes must match. However, in practice, you might encounter tensors of mismatched sizes. PyTorch provides several ways to deal with this, such as broadcasting, padding, and concatenation.

#### Broadcasting

Broadcasting automatically expands the sizes of tensors to match each other before performing element-wise operations.

```py
# Create tensors of different sizes
a = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
b = torch.tensor([[0], [1], [2]])

# Broadcasting allows for element-wise addition
result = a + b

print("Broadcasted Addition:", result)
```

### How Broadcasting Works

Broadcasting in PyTorch follows a set of rules to apply operations on tensors of different shapes. The essence of these rules is to make the shapes compatible for element-wise operations without actually copying data. Hereâ€™s a simplified overview of how broadcasting works:

1. **Identify the smaller tensor:** Compare the shapes of the two tensors from the last dimension backwards. The tensor with fewer dimensions is considered the smaller tensor.

2. **Expand the smaller tensor:** The shape of the smaller tensor is virtually expanded to match the shape of the larger tensor. This expansion is done by adding dimensions of size 1 at the beginning of the smaller tensor's shape.

3. **Stretch dimensions of size 1:** Dimensions of size 1 in either tensor are stretched to match the corresponding dimension of the other tensor. This stretching is only conceptual; data is not actually replicated in memory.
4. **Element-wise operation:** The operation is applied element-wise on the expanded tensors.

### When Broadcasting is Useful

Broadcasting is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations between tensors of different shapes without wanting to manually resize or replicate tensors, which can be cumbersome and inefficient. Some common use cases include:

* Element-wise operations between tensors of different sizes: For example, adding a vector to each row or column of a matrix without looping.

* Applying a scalar operation to a tensor: Such as adding a scalar value to all elements of a tensor or multiplying a tensor by a scalar.

* Performing operations on tensors of different dimensions: For instance, adding a 2D matrix to a 3D tensor along a particular axis.

```py
# 2D tensor (matrix) of shape [2, 3]
matrix = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3],
                       [4, 5, 6]])

# 1D tensor (vector) of shape [3]
vector = torch.tensor([1, 0, 1])

# Broadcasting the vector across each row of the matrix
result = matrix + vector

print("Broadcasted Addition Result:\n", result)
```

#### Padding

Padding adds zeros (or other values) to a tensor to reach a desired size.

```py
# Create a tensor
c = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Pad the tensor to a larger size
padded_c = torch.nn.functional.pad(c, (1, 1, 1, 1), 'constant', 0)

print("Padded Tensor:", padded_c)
```

### Common Tensor-Related Problems

Handling real-world data, especially audio, often involves dealing with tensors in various shapes and forms. Here are some common issues and tips on how to address them:

#### Variable Length Sequences
In audio processing, you might encounter variable-length audio clips. A common approach is to pad the sequences to have the same length before batching them together.

#### Memory Issues
When working with large tensors, it's easy to run into memory issues. Efficient memory usage involves:

* Using in-place operations when possible (operations that end with an underscore, like `add_()`).

* Moving tensors to the GPU for faster computation and to leverage GPU memory.

## Handling Mismatched Tensor Sizes

In practice, you may find tensors that don't match in size, which can be problematic for operations that require tensors of the same dimensions. PyTorch provides several ways to address this, such as reshaping, slicing, or using functions like torch.cat() for concatenation and torch.stack() for stacking tensors along a new dimension.

## In-Place Operations: `add_()`

PyTorch supports in-place operations, which modify tensors directly and can help save memory. These operations are denoted by an underscore suffix (`_`). For example, `add_()` adds a value to the tensor in-place, altering the original tensor without creating a new one.

```py
# In-place addition
x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
x.add_(1)  # Adds 1 to each element in-place
print("In-place addition:", x)
```

## Working with Audio Data: Mono and Stereo

When dealing with audio data, understanding the tensor shape in relation to audio channels is crucial. Mono audio has a single channel, while stereo audio has two channels. This distinction affects the tensor shape:

* **Mono audio** is typically represented as a one-dimensional tensor of shape `[samples]`, where `samples` is the number of audio samples.

* **Stereo audio**, on the other hand, may be represented as a two-dimensional tensor of shape `[2, samples]`, with one row for each channel (left and right).
Handling stereo audio requires being mindful of these dimensions, especially when performing operations that might alter the tensor's shape.

Handling stereo audio requires being mindful of these dimensions, especially when performing operations that might alter the tensor's shape.

```py
# Example of a stereo audio tensor
stereo_audio = torch.rand(2, 48000)  # Simulating stereo audio with random values
print("Stereo audio tensor shape:", stereo_audio.shape)

# Example of a mono audio tensor
mono_audio = torch.rand(48000)  # Simulating mono audio with random values
print("Mono audio tensor shape:", mono_audio.shape)
```

## Collapsing a Stereo Recorded Audio File into Mono

Often times you will have to collapse stereo files into mono in order to work with massive datasets. To convert a stereo audio file into mono, you can average the two channels. This process involves summing the left and right channels and then dividing by two. This can be efficiently done using PyTorch tensor operations. Why the average instead of just dropping one of the channels? Because when we convert to mono, we integrate characteristics from both the left and right channels into one, thus preserving the essence of the data.

```py
# Simulating a stereo audio tensor with random data
stereo_audio = torch.rand((2, 1000))  # Shape is [2, 1000] for stereo

# Collapsing the stereo audio into mono by averaging the two channels
mono_audio = torch.mean(stereo_audio, dim=0)  # Take the mean across the first dimension

print("Mono audio shape:", mono_audio.shape)  # The shape will be [1000], representing mono audio
```
